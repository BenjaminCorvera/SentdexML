# Reccurent Neural Network
    ## Basics
        - Good for sequential data where each part of a sequence carries significance
          - Time series data (data is organzied temporally or chronologically)
          - Natural Language Processing
        - Each cell cell outputs something, but also passes output along to another cell
          - Nodes have forget gates (choose what to forget)
        - The hardest part is preprocessing data 
          - Hard to stucture data correctly
